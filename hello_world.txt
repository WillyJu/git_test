Hello World! My name is William Ju. I was 3 years into a BioChem degree before deciding to make the change to Computer Science! My wife and I were lucky enough to welcome into the world a beautiful little girl named Adalynn recently and I would love to find a job that allows me to work remotely so I can have as active a role in her life as possible! I'm fairly new to all this so I am attempting to work through the Odin Project while obtaining my Computer Science bachelor's from Eastern Washington University.
